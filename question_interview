 You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.
The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:
•	A single period '.' represents the current directory.
•	A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
•	Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
•	Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.
The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:
•	The path must start with a single slash '/'.
•	Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
•	The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
•	The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
Return the simplified canonical path.
 
Example 1:
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation:
The trailing slash should be removed.
Example 2:
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation:
Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
Example 3:
Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
Explanation:
A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).
Example 4:
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation:
Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.
Example 5:
Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
Output: "/.../b/d"
Explanation:
"..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

Design an LRU Cache with Expiry and Priority-based Eviction
🧠 Objective:
Design and implement a high-performance in-memory cache that behaves like an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, but with two additional real-world constraints:
•	Time-to-live (TTL): Keys can expire after a set number of seconds.
•	Priority-based eviction: When evicting due to capacity, the key with the lowest priority is evicted first. If priorities are equal, use LRU order.
________________________________________
🚀 Functional Requirements:
Your class should support the following methods:
__init__(self, capacity: int)
•	Initializes the cache with a fixed capacity.
•	The cache must hold at most capacity keys at any time.
________________________________________
put(self, key: str, value: Any, ttl: Optional[int] = None, priority: int = 0) -> None
•	Inserts or updates the value for the given key.
•	ttl: Optional time-to-live in seconds. If set, the key should auto-expire after ttl seconds from insertion.
•	priority: Integer representing eviction priority. Higher values = more important = harder to evict.
•	If the cache is full: 
1.	Remove expired keys first.
2.	If still full, evict the key with lowest priority.
3.	If multiple keys have the same priority, evict the least recently used among them.
________________________________________
get(self, key: str) -> Any
•	Returns the value associated with the key only if: 
o	It exists in the cache
o	It has not expired
•	If not found or expired, return -1.
________________________________________
✅ Behavior Example
cache = AdvancedLRUCache(2)

cache.put("a", 1, ttl=5, priority=2)   # stores "a"cache.put("b", 2, ttl=5, priority=3)   # stores "b"print(cache.get("a"))  # Output: 1
cache.put("c", 3, ttl=5, priority=1)   # Cache is full. # "c" has lowest priority, but "a" has been used less recently than "b" # "a" is evicted (even though it has higher priority than "c") due to lower recencyprint(cache.get("a"))  # Output: -1 print(cache.get("b"))  # Output: 2 print(cache.get("c"))  # Output: 3 
________________________________________
💡 Notes:
•	Assume wall clock time can be obtained using time.time().
•	TTL countdown should start from time of insertion.
•	You don’t need background cleanup; just check expiry during get() or put().
•	You can use OrderedDict, heapq, or custom doubly linked list for LRU management.
________________________________________
🧪 Bonus Challenge:
•	Add size() method: return the number of non-expired keys in the cache.
•	Add optional max_priority_only=True flag to get() that returns value only if it's the highest-priority item.


5. How do microservices communicate with each other?
Expect candidates to mention synchronous APIs like REST or GraphQL and asynchronous messaging, for example via Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
Microservices often communicate through stateless methods which require each call to contain all the information needed to complete the request. They can also communicate through event-driven approaches which help in decoupling and asynchronous interaction.
6. Can you explain the role of a service mesh in microservices architecture?
A service mesh provides a transparent and dynamic way to manage service-to-service communication and is responsible for routing traffic, handling failures, service discovery, and security.
Candidates might mention tools such as Istio or Linkerd.

19.	flask- how to add db in flask and use it
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
In your app.py file import SQLAlchemy as shown in the below code. We also need to add a configuration setting to our application so that we can use SQLite database in our application. We also need to create an SQLAlchemy database instance which is as simple as creating an object.
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.debug = True

# adding configuration for using a sqlite database
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'

# Creating an SQLAlchemy instance
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

20.	What are context managers in Python and how are they implemented?
Context managers in Python are used to manage resources, ensuring that they are properly acquired and released. The most common use of context managers is the with statement
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.file.close()

with FileManager('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')
In this example, the FileManager class is a context manager that ensures the file is properly closed after it is used within the with statement.
What are decorators in Python? 
Decorators in Python are a design pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. They are commonly used to extend the behavior of functions or methods.
Example:
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper


# Output:
# Something is happening before the function is called.
# Hello!
# Something is happening after the function is called.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a sub
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol       ValueI             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
•	I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
•	X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
•	C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "III"Output: 3Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:
Input: s = "LVIII"Output: 58Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"Output: 1994Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Schema:
•	employee_id (int)
•	employee_name (varchar)
•	department (varchar)
•	salary (decimal)
 
The goal will be to find the top 5 countries with the highest average age for customers, but only include countries that have more than 1 customer. The result should display the country and the average age, ordered by average age in descending order
 

write a function to check if a given string is valid IPv4 address.

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Explanation:
•	There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
•	The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
•	The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
